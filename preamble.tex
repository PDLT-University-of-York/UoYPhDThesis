%% Purpose: In this document you list all the packages you want as
% well as setting the different macros that you will want

%%% ==== Fonts
% We recommend to set some nicer fonts than the default
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}  % Allow unicode input
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage{lmodern}         % A nice scalable font based on Computer Modern.
                             % For more options, see e.g.
                             % https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/59706/27664

%%% ===== Folder structure
% In order to use a structure of a thesis split into multiple files,
% we use the subfiles package and set the name of the corresponding 
% main file to allow references
\usepackage{subfiles}
\externaldocument[XR-]{\subfix{thesis}}

% Set in the following the name of the folder(s) containing figures to
% facilitate their inclusion in the 
\graphicspath{
  {Figures/} % others appended next to it, e.g.: {Drawings/}{Graphs/}...
}


%%% ===== BEGIN OVERLEAF_EXTERNAL_DOC
%% For Overleaf only, in order to allow cross referencing to work in subfiles
%% uncomment the following lines:
%
%\makeatletter
%\newcommand*{\addFileDependency}[1]{% argument=file name and extension
%  \typeout{(#1)}
%  \@addtofilelist{#1}
%  \IfFileExists{#1}{}{\typeout{No file #1.}}
%}
%\makeatother
%
%\newcommand*{\myexternaldocument}[1]{%
%    \externaldocument[XR-]{\subfix{#1}}%
%    \addFileDependency{\subfix{#1.tex}} % in general this can be left out to speed up compilation time
%    \addFileDependency{\subfix{#1.aux}}%
%}
%
%%% ====== END OVERLEAF_EXTERNAL_DOC


%%% ===== Packages used for the purpose of this example (can be removed later)
\usepackage{verbatim} % to make the code-like elements
\usepackage[math]{blindtext} % to make the auto-generated lipsum parts


%%% ===== List of recommended packages you need to include
% NOTE: Package for the todo notes. Notice that it uses multiple packages such as
% ifthen, xkeyval, xcolor, tikz (w/ graphicx) and calc, and thus they need
% to be called before todonotes if specific options are wanted.
% Very useful to track todos in the margins, and with the option 
% `obeyDraft', all todos disappear when setting the class into `final'
\usepackage{xcolor} % to use colours in different parts
\usepackage[obeyDraft, textsize=small, colorinlistoftodos]{todonotes}

% Unless you passed the option `nohyperref' to the uoythesis class, the hyperref 
% package is already loaded, and should be set up using the hypersetup command
% (see the hyperref documentation for details)
\hypersetup{%
  colorlinks=true, % color hyperlinks instead of putting boxes around them
 	linkcolor=blue!80!black, % references in dark blue
	citecolor=green!60!black, % citations in green
	filecolor=magenta,     % cross-references in darker magenta
  % uncomment and fill in below to add metadata to pdf for accessibility reasons  
%  pdfinfo={ 
%	   Title={Thesis title},
%		 Subject={subject of thesis},
%    Author={Your name},
%    Keywords={keyword1; keyword2...},
%    Language={English}
%  }
}

%%% ===== List the packages you want to use
%% NOTE: you might need to take care of the order in which some are included,
%% such as ticz/graphicx that need to go above todonotes
\usepackage{xspace} % for automatic spaces after text commands
\usepackage{amsmath, amsthm}
\usepackage{amssymb, amsfonts}
\usepackage{mathrsfs} %for stylistic AG
\usepackage{url}


%%% ===== Bibliography setup
% It is strongly advised to automate your bibliography through a bib file
% and to maintain it through a appropriate software like Jabref.
\usepackage[eprint,          % Include information for pre-prints.
            doi=false,
            eprint=true,
            url=false,
            maxnames=10,     % Truncate lists of more than 10 authors.
            giveninits=true, % Only output the initials of an author's given
                             % names.
            safeinputenc     % Fix for biber not playing nice with breve accents
                             % (i.e. \u{}), see
                             % https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/170586/27664.
           ]{biblatex}
% add each of you bibliography files with extension with path relatively
% to this preamble file
\addbibresource{\subfix{Bibfiles/firstbib.bib}}

%%% ===== List of your own macros here
\newcommand{\AG}{\ensuremath{\mathscr{A\hspace*{-3pt}{G}}}\xspace}
