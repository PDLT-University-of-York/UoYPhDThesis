%%% ==== Set options of class
% Possible options:
% - pagenb: with value `head' or `foot', sets the placement of the page number
%     in the header or the footer
% - spine, foredge, top, bottom: takes a dimension as a value (e.g. 2cm) to 
%     set the margin value of the corresponding sides
% - hratio, vratio: respectively horizontal and vertical ratio value between
%     the margins of that direction (spine/foredge and top/bottom)
% - hmargins, vmargins: set the dimension given to make symmetrical margins 
%     respectively horizontally or vertically
% - margins: a set of `key=value' commands taking any of the above margin keys
% Example: default values as equivalent to the following
\uoythsetup{
  pagenb=head,
  hmargins=3cm,
  vmargins=4cm
}

% Margins of the document can also be set using some helper macros defined 
% by the class using one of: \horizontalmarginsvalue, \horizontalmarginsratio,
% \verticalmarginsvalue or \verticalmarginsratio (see documentation for details
% on their use).
% Examples:
%   \horizontalmarginsvalue{3cm} %-> sets both spine and foredge margin to 3cm (current default)
%   \horizontalmarginsvalue[2cm]{3cm} %-> sets spine to 3cm and foredge to 2cm
%   \horizontalmarginsratio[0.8]{40mm} %-> sets spine to 4cm and foredge to 3.2cm (4*0.8)


%%% ==== Styling chapters/sections
% See the manual of the `memoir` class for more predefined styles:
% - Appendix B for chapter styles (or for more examples consult
%   https://ctan.uib.no/info/latex-samples/MemoirChapStyles/MemoirChapStyles.pdf);
% - Section 6.9 for lower level heading styles.
% To learn how to define your own, see Chapter 6.
% The order of call between \headstyles and \chapterstyle is important since
% the chapter header is defined in both of these, but the former defines
% the other sections style headers, so calling \headstyle second would
% override the parameters of \chapterstyle.

% As a default, use `dowding' for the [sub]sections headers and 
% `dash' for the chapter style
\headstyles{dowding}
\chapterstyle{dash}

% Typesetting of the sectionning commands can easily be modified to suit
% one's preferences (see 6.6 of memoir package documentation).
% As an example, this thesis template is set as:
\setsecheadstyle{\normalfont\large\MakeTextUppercase} %-> sections in large CAPS
\setsubsecheadstyle{\normalfont\scshape} %-> subsections in small caps
\setsubsecindent{1em} %-> indent subsections by 1em
\setsubsubsecheadstyle{\normalfont\normalsize\itshape} %-> subsubsections in italics
\setsubsubsecindent{2em} %-> subsubsections indented
\setparaheadstyle{\normalfont\normalsize\slshape} %-> paragraphs in slanted
% Making the title and number of the chapter bigger and in bold
\renewcommand*{\chapnumfont}{\normalfont\LARGE\bfseries}
\renewcommand*{\chaptitlefont}{\normalfont\LARGE\bfseries}

%%% ==== Styling lists
% Uncomment one of the options below to reduce the spacing between list items.
% See Section 8.6 of the manual of the `memoir` class.
\firmlists   % Slightly less space than the default
% \tightlists  % No extra space

%%% ==== Differences between draft and final version
\RequirePackage{graphicx}
\ifdraftdoc
  %% Extra options for draft versions only
  % NOTE: `draftwatermark` needs a scalable font.
  \usepackage[firstpageonly]{draftwatermark}  % Watermark on the front page
\else
  % Extra package for final version only
  \usepackage{microtype}                      % Enable microtypographical adjustments
\fi

%%% ==== Helper to fix cross-refs in subfiles
\ifuoyth@noxr
\else
  \newcommand{\fixsubfilexr}{
    \let\oldref\ref 
    \AtBeginDocument{\renewcommand{\ref}[1]{\@ifundefined{r@##1}{\oldref{XR-##1}}{\oldref{##1}}}}
  }
\fi
